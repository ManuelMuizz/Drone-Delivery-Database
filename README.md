# Drone-Delivery-Database
This is a prototype database for an e-commerce store that uses drones to deliver goods to customers.
The script demonstrates how to create very basic and simple tables for the database, and contains sufficient dummy data that can be inserted into the database and used to run sql queries.
The script was developed in Oracle Sql Developer and the database enivronment used was Oracle 11g XE.
This was an individual assignment for my Information Systems module. As such, the dummy data displayed in the database is completely fictional. 
When creating the database, a user IFS244A2 had to be created first to run the script successfully without errors. The name of the user was a requirement in the assignment. This name can be changed to suit the needs of the reader. 

To improve the current databas, I would advise separating the 'Deliveries' table and create a new table called 'DeliveryDetails' to store some of the information found in the 'Deliveries' table.
